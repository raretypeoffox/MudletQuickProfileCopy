MudletQuickProfileCopy
Python Script to quickly create/update multiple profiles in Mudlet
==================================================================


Script is designed to take the most recent Mudlet package of the source profile and copy it to a list of other profiles
If a given profile doesn't exist, it will be created by copying the source profile to the new target profile.
Additionally, it copies files specified in the main parent directory over. This feature is to supplment
Vagonuth's AVATAR package and is completely optional (i.e. profile_files_to_copy can be commented out.)

To copy all of the source profiles Triggers/Alias/Scripts etc., all we need to do is copy the most recent *.xml file
from the source profile's "current" directory.

=== SETUP ===

The top of the script contains customizable variables you'll need to edit:

# Define customizable variables
username = 'WindowsUsername'  # Change this to the actual username
profile_name = 'MainMudletProfileName'  # Change this to your main profile name (ie where we will copy from)
profile_files_to_copy = ['AltList.lua', 'InventoryList.lua']  # List of additional files to copy (leave as default for Vagonuth package)

# Define source directories and files
base_directory = fr'C:\Users\{username}\.config\mudlet\profiles'    # by default, where Mudlet keeps profiles on Windows (edit if needed)
source_directory = os.path.join(base_directory, profile_name, 'current')
profile_file_path = 'profiles.txt'  # Path to the file containing profile names
base_target_directory = base_directory  # Base directory for target profiles

=== LIST OF PROFILES ===

Create a file "profiles.txt" that contains a list of your Profile Names. Profile names should ideally be the character's name.
The format of "profiles.txt" is one profile/character name per line. Line's that are blank or start with a # are ignored.
Names are case sensitive. An example:

# profiles.txt
Alpha
Bravo
Charlie
